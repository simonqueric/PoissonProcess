# Projects on Poisson Processes

Here is a repository on projects about Poisson Processes. 
There are 3 projects : 

- One about detection of change of intensity in a count process
- A second about Hawkes Processes for cyber attack modelling
- Another about outage probability in the OFDMA protocol

The projects where done with Maxime Megel and Vincent Herfeld.
The course was teached by Laurent Decreusefond.
